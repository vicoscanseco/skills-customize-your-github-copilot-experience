# 📘 Assignment: Python Text Processing

## 🎯 Objective

Learn to manipulate strings, read and write files, and process text data in Python. You'll build practical programs that work with real text files to perform useful operations.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️	String Manipulation Tool

#### Description
Create a Python program that takes text input and performs various string operations. Your program should provide a menu of operations that users can choose from to transform their text.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Accept text input from the user
- Provide at least 5 string operations: convert to uppercase, convert to lowercase, count words, reverse text, and replace a word/phrase
- Display the result of each operation clearly
- Use a loop to allow multiple operations without restarting the program
- Handle empty input gracefully with appropriate error messages


### 🛠️	File Processing Application

#### Description
Build a program that reads data from a text file, processes it, and writes the results to a new file. You'll work with the provided sample text file to extract and analyze information.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Read content from a text file using proper file I/O methods
- Count and display statistics: total lines, total words, total characters
- Find the longest word in the file
- Create a new file with processed output (e.g., line numbers added, words sorted, or text cleaned)
- Use `with` statements for proper file handling
- Include error handling for file not found scenarios
